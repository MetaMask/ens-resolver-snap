# ENS resolver Snap

This Snap demonstrates forward and reverse name resolution based on ENS.

You have to specify an `INFURA_PROJECT_ID` environment variable to build or test the project.
It might work without one, but it will be severely slow.

After installing the snap in [MetaMask Flask](https://metamask.io/flask/), use any address input field to type in an ENS
name.
